Dear <?php print $name; ?>,

We are pleased that you're coming to our Info-Session on <?php print $date; ?>. You will have an opportunity to mingle followed by a brief overview of the program and a Q and A session. It will conclude approximately an hour later, but please feel free to "hang-out" afterwards to talk with an instructor, the staff, current students or prospective students. The address is as follows:

9080 Irvine Center Dr., 2nd Floor
Irvine, CA 92618

If you have any immediate questions now, we are available to speak with you over the phone M-F, from 9:00AM-5:00PM at (949) 679-7699. Alternatively, you can reach out to us via our Facebook page at http://www.facebook.com/learningfuze.com, or emailing us directly at support@learningfuze.com.

We'll see you there!

LearningFuze Team
